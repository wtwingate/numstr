        What if I told you that with the power of modern technology, you could
        take all the numbers from 1 to 123, <em>programmatically</em> convert
        them to their English names (e.g. &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;,
        &quot;three&quot;...), and then concatenate them into one mega string?
        Would you be impressed? Well, what if you could also take that huge
        heckin&apos; chonker of a string and run some data analysis on it and
        display the results in a pretty interactive graph? And what if the
        background did some cool stuff too?
